# math-machine

    My Goal for this project was to learn about states, hooks, 
    as well as reinforce the JS that I have been learning.
    
  I really didn't put any effort into styling this app, considering it's not something that would ever be used. That being said, 
I wanted to make sure the flow of data was easy to follow, and that the code itself was easy to understand. 
    -Using useEffect() and useState() to keep the app responsive to changes and inputs
    -Not too in depth of JS since the machine is only making calculations and displaying the data.
